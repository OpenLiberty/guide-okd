[.hidden]
NOTE: This repository contains the guide documentation source. To view the guide in published form, view it on the https://openliberty.io/guides/{projectid}.html[Open Liberty website^].

Explore how to use Minishift to deploy microservices to an Origin Community Distribution of Kubernetes (OKD) cluster. 

// *********************************************************************************************

== What you'll learn 

You will learn how to deploy two simple microservices with Open Liberty to an Origin Community Distribution of Kubernetes (OKD) cluster that is running in 
Minishift.

=== What is Origin Community Distribution of Kubernetes (OKD)?

OKD, formerly known as OpenShift Origin, is the upstream open source project for all OpenShift products. 
OKD is a Kubernetes-based platform with added functionality. 
OKD streamlines the DevOps process by providing an intuitive development pipeline. 
It also provides integration with multiple tools to make the deployment and management of cloud applications easier.

To learn more about OKD, check out the https://www.okd.io/[official OKD page^]. 
To learn more about the different platforms that Red Hat OpenShift offers, 
check out the https://docs.openshift.com[official OpenShift documentation^]. 
If you would like to learn more about Kubernetes, check out 
the https://openliberty.io/guides/kubernetes-intro.html[Deploying microservices to Kubernetes^] guide.

Using Maven, you will build the `system` microservice that collects basic system properties from your system and the `inventory` microservice that will 
interact with the `system` microservice. Then, you will learn how to deploy both to the cluster and establish communication between them.

You will use Minishift, a tool for you to run OKD on a local system. 
Minishift allows developers to deploy a quick and easy OKD cluster for application development.

Minishift is based on OKD 3.11.
To run OKD 4.1 or newer on your local system, you can use the CodeReady Containers tool instead.
To learn how to use CodeReady Containers, check out the
https://openliberty.io/guides/openshift-codeready-containers.html[Deploying microservices to OpenShift using CodeReady Containers^] guide.

// *********************************************************************************************

== Additional prerequisites 

The following tools need to be installed:

* *Minishift:* With Minishift, you can try OKD by running a VM with a single-node cluster.
You can use Minishift with any OS, making it a convenient and flexible tool for testing and development.
For installation instructions, refer to the official 
https://docs.okd.io/latest/minishift/index.html[OKD Minishift documentation^].

To verify that Minishift is installed correctly, run the following command:

[role=command]
```
minishift version
```

The output is similar to:

[role="no_copy"]
----
minishift v1.34.1+c2ff9cb
----

* *Docker:* Docker is a containerization software for building the containers that you will eventually deploy onto the OKD cluster. For installation 
instructions, refer to the official https://docs.docker.com/install/[Docker documentation^].

To verify that Docker is installed correctly, run the following command:

[role=command]
```
docker version
```

The output is similar to:

[role="no_copy"]
----
Client: Docker Engine - Community
 Version:           19.03.5
----

// *********************************************************************************************

//== Getting Started

[role=command]
include::{common-includes}/gitclone.adoc[]

// *********************************************************************************************

== Starting Minishift

=== Deploying the cluster

Run the following command to start Minishift and create the OKD cluster:

[role=command]
```
minishift start
```

If the cluster started successfully, you see the following output:

[role="no_copy"]
----
Server Information ...
OpenShift server started.

The server is accessible via web console at:
    https://192.168.99.103:8443/console
----

=== Logging in to the cluster

To interact with the OpenShift cluster, you need to use the `oc` command.
Minishift already includes the `oc` binary.
To use the `oc` commands, run the following command to configure your PATH to include the binary:

[role=command]
```
minishift oc-env
```

The resulting output differs based on your OS and environment, but you get an output similar to the following:

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]
[.tab_content.linux_section]
--
[role="no_copy"]
----
export PATH="/root/.minishift/cache/oc/v3.11.0/linux:$PATH"
# Run this command to configure your command-line session:
# eval $(minishift oc-env)
----

Run the appropriate command to configure your environment:

[role=command]
```
eval $(minishift oc-env)
```
--

[.tab_content.mac_section]
--
[role="no_copy"]
----
export PATH="/Users/guidesbot@ibm.com/.minishift/cache/oc/v3.11.0/darwin:$PATH"
# Run this command to configure your command-line session:
# eval $(minishift oc-env)
----

Run the appropriate command to configure your environment:

[role=command]
```
eval $(minishift oc-env)
```
--

[.tab_content.windows_section] 
--
[role="no_copy"]
----
SET PATH=C:\Users\guides-bot\.minishift\cache\oc\v3.11.0\windows;%PATH%
REM Run this command to configure your command-line session:
REM     @FOR /f "tokens=*" %i IN ('minishift oc-env') DO @call %i
----

Run the appropriate command to configure your environment:

[role=command]
```
@FOR /f "tokens=*" %i IN ('minishift oc-env') DO @call %i
```
--

You can run through the development cycle by using OpenShift's web console through the URL provided in the command output of the `minishift start` 
command. You can also run the following command to open the web console:

[role=command]
```
minishift console
```

You can log in with the following credentials:

[role="no_copy"]
----
User:     developer
Password: [any value]
----

The web console provides a GUI alternative to their CLI tools that you can explore on your own.
This guide will continue with the CLI tools.

You can confirm your credentials by running the `oc whoami` command. You will get `developer` as your output.

Next, create a new OpenShift project by running the following command:

[role=command]
```
oc new-project [project-name]
```

You are now ready to build and deploy a microservice.

// *********************************************************************************************

== Building the system microservice

//file 0
Dockerfile
[source, Text, linenums, role="code_column"]
----
include::finish/system/Dockerfile[]
----

A simple microservice named `system` will be packaged, containerized, and deployed onto the OKD cluster.
The `system` microservice collects the JVM properties of the host machine.

Navigate to the `start` directory. 

The source code of the `system` and `inventory` microservices is located at the `system` and `inventory` directories. 
Focus on the `system` microservice first, and you will learn about the `inventory` microservice later.

In the `start` directory, run the following command to package the `system` microservice:

[role=command]
```
mvn -pl system package
```

The `mvn package` command compiles, verifies, and builds the project.
The resulting compiled code is packaged into a `war` web archive that can be found under the `system/target` directory.
The archive contains the application that is needed to run the microservice on an Open Liberty,
and it is now ready to be injected into a Docker container for deployment.

== Containerizing the system microservice

=== Reusing the Docker daemon

To simplify the local deployment process, you can reuse the built-in Minishift Docker daemon.
Reusing the Minishift Docker daemon allows you to use the internal Docker registry,
so you don't have to build a Docker registry on your machine.
To reuse the Docker daemon, run the following command to point your command-line session to use the Minishift's daemon:

[role=command]
```
minishift docker-env
```

The result of the command is a list of bash environment variable exports that configure your environment to reuse the Docker daemon inside the single 
Minishift VM instance. The commands differ based on your OS and environment, but you get an output similar to the following example:

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]
[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]
--
[role=no_copy]
----
export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY="1"
export DOCKER_HOST="tcp://192.168.99.103:2376"
export DOCKER_CERT_PATH="/Users/guidesbot@ibm.com/.minishift/certs"
# Run this command to configure your command-line session:
# eval $(minishift docker-env)
----

Run the `eval` command to configure your environment:

[role=command]
```
eval $(minishift docker-env)
```
--

[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
[role=no_copy]
----
SET DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1
SET DOCKER_HOST=tcp://9.26.69.218:2376
SET DOCKER_CERT_PATH=C:\Users\maihameed\.minishift\certs
REM Run this command to configure your command-line session:
REM     @FOR /f "tokens=*" %i IN ('minishift docker-env') DO @call %i
----

Run the given `@FOR` command to configure your environment:

[role=command]
```
@FOR /f "tokens=*" %i IN ('minishift docker-env') DO @call %i
```
--

=== Building the Docker image

include::{common-includes}/ol-kernel-docker-pull.adoc[]

Now that the environment is set up, ensure that you are in the `start` directory and run the following command to build the `system` Docker image:

[role=command]
```
docker build -t system system/
```

The command builds an image named `system` from the [hotspot file=0]`Dockerfile` provided in the `system` directory.
To verify that the images are built, run the following command to list all local Docker images:

[role=command]
```
docker images
```

Your `system` image should appear in the list of all Docker images:

[role=no_copy]
----
REPOSITORY             TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
system                 latest              e8a8393e9364        2 minutes ago       399MB
----

=== Accessing the internal registry

To run the microservice on the OKD cluster, you need to push the microservice image into a container image registry.
You will use the OpenShift integrated container image registry called OpenShift Container Registry (OCR).
First, you must authenticate your Docker client to your OCR. Start by running the login command:

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]
[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]
--
[role=command]
```
echo $(oc whoami -t) | docker login -u developer --password-stdin $(oc registry info)
```
--

[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
Because the Windows command prompt doesn’t support the command substitution that is displayed for Mac and Linux, run the following commands: 
[role=command]
```
oc whoami
oc whoami -t
oc registry info
```

Replace the square brackets in the following `docker login` command with the results from the previous commands:
[role=command]
```
docker login -u [oc whoami] -p [oc whoami -t] [oc registry info]
```
--

Now you must tag and push your `system` microservice to the internal registry so that it is accessible for deployment.
Run the following command to tag your microservice:

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]
[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]
--
[role=command]
```
docker tag system $(oc registry info)/$(oc project -q)/system
```
--

[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
Run the following commands:  
[role=command]
```
oc registry info
oc project -q
```

Replace the square brackets in the following `docker tag` command with the results from the previous commands:
[role=command]
```
docker tag system [oc registry info]/[oc project -q]/system
```
--

Your newly tagged image should appear in the list of all Docker images:

[role=no_copy]
----
REPOSITORY                             TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
system                                 latest              e8a8393e9364        2 minutes ago       399MB
172.30.1.1:5000/my-project/system      latest              e8a8393e9364        2 minutes ago       399MB
----

Now push your newly tagged image to the internal registry by running the following command:

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]
[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]
--
[role=command]
```
docker push $(oc registry info)/$(oc project -q)/system
```
--

[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
Run the following commands:
[role=command]
```
oc registry info
oc project -q
```

Replace the square brackets in the following `docker push` command with the results from the previous commands:
[role=command]
```
docker push [oc registry info]/[oc project -q]/system
```
--

The microservice is now ready for deployment.

== Deploying the system microservice

Now that the `system` Docker image is built, deploy it using a resource configuration file.
Since OKD is built on top of Kubernetes, it supports the same concepts and deployment strategies.
The OpenShift `oc` CLI tool supports most of the same commands as the Kubernetes `kubectl` tool.
To learn more about Kubernetes and resource configuration files,
check out the https://openliberty.io/guides/kubernetes-intro.html[Deploying microservices to Kubernetes^] guide.

The provided [hotspot file=0]`deploy.yaml` configuration file outlines a [hotspot=deployment file=0]`deployment`
resource that creates and deploys a container named [hotspot=container file=0]`system-container`.
This container will run the Docker-formatted image provided in the [hotspot=image file=0]`image` field.
The [hotspot=image file=0]`image` field should point to your newly pushed image. 

//file 0
deploy.yaml
[source, yaml, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=everythingButSystemDeployment']
----
include::finish/deploy.yaml[]
----

Run the following command to view the image stream:

[role=command]
```
oc get imagestream
```

You should find your newly pushed image:

[role=no_copy]
----
NAME      DOCKER REPO                         TAGS      UPDATED
system    172.30.1.1:5000/my-project/system   latest    5 minutes ago
----

The OpenShift image stream displays all the Docker-formatted container images that are pushed to the internal registry.
You can configure builds and deployments to trigger when an image is updated.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Update the `deploy.yaml` file in the `start` directory.#
`deploy.yaml`
----
[role="edit_command_text"]
The system [hotspot=image file=0]`image` field specifies the name and tag of the container image that you want to use for the system container. Update the 
value of the system [hotspot=image file=0]`image` field to specify the image location found in the `DOCKER REPO` column from the output of the 
following command:

[role=command]
```
oc get imagestream
```

After you update the value of the system [hotspot=image file=0]`image` field,
run the following command to apply the configuration file and create your OpenShift resource:

[role=command]
```
oc apply -f deploy.yaml
```

You get an output similar to the following example:

[role=no_copy]
----
deployment.apps/system-deployment created
----

Run the following command to view your pods:

[role=command]
```
oc get pods
```

Ensure that your `system-deployment` pod is `Running`:

[role=no_copy]
----
NAME                                 READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
system-deployment-768f95cf8f-fnjjj   1/1       Running   0          5m
----

Run the following command to get more details on your pod:

[role=command]
```
oc describe pod system-deployment
```

The pod description includes an events log, which is useful in debugging any issues that might arise.
The log is formatted similar to the following example:

[role=no_copy]
----
Events:
  Type    Reason     Age   From                Message
  ----    ------     ----  ----                -------
  Normal  Scheduled  1d    default-scheduler   Successfully assigned my-project/system-deployment-768f95cf8f-fnjjj to localhost
  Normal  Pulling    1d    kubelet, localhost  pulling image "172.30.1.1:5000/my-project/system"
  Normal  Pulled     1d    kubelet, localhost  Successfully pulled image "172.30.1.1:5000/my-project/system"
  Normal  Created    1d    kubelet, localhost  Created container
  Normal  Started    1d    kubelet, localhost  Started container
----

The container is deployed successfully, but it's isolated and cannot be accessed for requests.
A service needs to be created to expose your deployment so that you can make requests to your container.
You also must expose the service by using a route so that external users can access the microservice through a hostname.
Update your [hotspot file=1]`deploy.yaml` file to include service and route resources. 


[role='code_command hotspot file=1', subs="quotes"]
----
#Update the `deploy.yaml` file in the `start` directory.#
`deploy.yaml`
----
[role="edit_command_text"]
Update the configuration file to include the [hotspot=systemService file=1]`service` and [hotspot=systemRoute file=1]`route` resources.


//file 1
deploy.yaml
[source, yaml, linenums, role='code_column hide_tags=inventoryResources']
----
include::finish/deploy.yaml[]
----


To update your resources, run the following command:

[role=command]
```
oc apply -f deploy.yaml
```

Notice that the cluster only picks up changes, and doesn't tear down and rebuild the deployment if it hasn't changed:

[role=no_copy]
----
deployment.apps/system-deployment unchanged
service/system-service created
route/system-route created
----

You can view all of your routes by running the following command:

[role=command]
```
oc get routes
```

You get an output similar to the following example:

[role=no_copy]
----
NAME             HOST/PORT                                         PATH      SERVICES         PORT      TERMINATION   WILDCARD
system-route     system-route-my-project.192.168.99.103.nip.io               system-service   <all>                   None
----

Access your microservice through the hostname provided in the output, 
by going to the `http://[hostname]/system/properties` URL, or running the following command.
In the following command, replace `[hostname]` with the hostname provided by the `oc get routes` command.

[role=command]
```
curl http://[hostname]/system/properties
```

// *********************************************************************************************

== Deploying the inventory microservice

//file 0
deploy.yaml
[source, yaml, linenums, role="code_column"]
----
include::finish/deploy.yaml[]
----

Now that the `system` microservice is running, you will package and deploy the `inventory` microservice,
which adds the properties from the `system` microservice to the `inventory`.
This process demonstrates how to establish communication between pods inside a cluster.

=== Building the microservice

In the `start` directory, run the following command to package the `inventory` microservice:

[role=command]
```
mvn -pl inventory package
```

=== Containerizing the microservice

Run the following command to use the `inventory` Dockerfile to create an image:

[role=command]
```
docker build -t inventory inventory/
```

Next, tag and push the image to the internal registry.

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]
[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]
--
Run the following command to tag your microservice:
[role=command]
```
docker tag inventory $(oc registry info)/$(oc project -q)/inventory
```

Now push your newly tagged image to the internal registry by running the following command:
[role=command]
```
docker push $(oc registry info)/$(oc project -q)/inventory
```
--

[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
Run the following commands:
[role=command]
```
oc registry info
oc project -q
```

Replace the square brackets in the following command with the results from the previous commands to tag your microservice:
[role=command]
```
docker tag inventory [oc registry info]/[oc project -q]/inventory
```

Run the following command to push your microservice, ensuring to replace the square brackets:
[role=command]
```
docker push [oc registry info]/[oc project -q]/inventory
```
--

The microservice is now ready for deployment.

=== Deploying the microservice

You can use the same [hotspot file=0]`deploy.yaml` configuration file to deploy multiple microservices.
Update the configuration file to include the deployment, service, and route resources for your `inventory` microservice.

[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Update the `deploy.yaml` file in the `start` directory.#
`deploy.yaml`
----
[role="edit_command_text"]
Update the configuration file to add the [hotspot=inventoryResources file=0]`inventory` resources.
Make sure to update the inventory [hotspot=inventoryImage file=0]`image` field with the appropriate
image link found in the `DOCKER REPO` column from the output of the following command:

[role=command]
```
oc get imagestream
```

Now run the following command to allow the cluster to pick up the new changes:

[role=command]
```
oc apply -f deploy.yaml
```

Run the following command to get the hostname of the newly exposed `inventory` service:

[role=command]
```
oc get route inventory-route
```

You get an output similar to the following example:

[role=no_copy]
----
NAME              HOST/PORT                                    PATH      SERVICES            PORT      TERMINATION   WILDCARD
inventory-route   inventory-route-myproject.127.0.0.1.nip.io             inventory-service   <all>                   None
----

Go to the following `http://[hostname]/inventory/systems` URL or run the following `curl` command to view the current inventory.
In the `curl` command, replace the `[hostname]` with your appropriate hostname:

[role=command]
```
curl http://[hostname]/inventory/systems
```

You see a JSON response like the following example.
Your JSON response might not be formatted.
The sample output was formatted for readability:

[role=no_copy]
----
{
    "systems": [],
    "total": 0
}
----

Since this is a fresh deployment, there are no saved systems in the inventory. Go to the `http://[hostname]/inventory/systems/system-service` URL or run 
the following command to allow the `inventory` microservice to access the `system` microservice and save the `system` result in the `inventory`:

[role=command]
```
curl http://[hostname]/inventory/systems/system-service
```

You receive your JVM system properties as a response.
Go to the following `http://[hostname]/inventory/systems` URL or run the following command to recheck the inventory:

[role=command]
```
curl http://[hostname]/inventory/systems
```

You see the following response:

[role=no_copy]
----
{
    "systems": [
        {
            "hostname": "system-service",
            "properties": {
                "os.name": "Linux",
                "user.name": "unknown"
            }
        }
    ],
    "total": 1
}
----

Notice that the system count incremented by 1 and provided a list of a few key fields that are retrieved from the system response.

== Testing the microservices

pom.xml
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column']
----
include::finish/inventory/pom.xml[]
----

A few tests are included for you to test the basic functions of the microservices.
If a test failure occurs, then you might have introduced a bug into the code.
To run the tests, wait for all pods to be in the ready state before you proceed further.
The default parameters that are defined in the [hotspot file=0]`pom.xml` file are:

[cols="15, 100", options="header"]
|===
| *Parameter*                                           | *Description*
| [hotspot=systemIP]`system.ip`                         | IP or hostname of the `system-service` Kubernetes Service
| [hotspot=inventoryIP]`inventory.ip`                   | IP or hostname of the `inventory-service` Kubernetes Service
|===

Use the following command to run the integration tests against your running cluster:

include::{common-includes}/os-tabs.adoc[]
[.tab_content.windows_section]
--
Run the following command, noting the values of the `system` and `inventory` route hostnames:

[role=command]
```
oc get routes
```

Substitute `[system-route-hostname]` and `[inventory-route-hostname]` with the appropriate values and run the following command:

[role=command]
```
mvn verify -Ddockerfile.skip=true -Dsystem.ip=[system-route-hostname] -Dinventory.ip=[inventory-route-hostname]
```
--
[.tab_content.mac_section.linux_section]

[role=command]
```
mvn verify -Ddockerfile.skip=true \
-Dsystem.ip=$(oc get route system-route -o=jsonpath='{.spec.host}') \
-Dinventory.ip=$(oc get route inventory-route -o=jsonpath='{.spec.host}')

* The `dockerfile.skip` parameter is set to `true` to skip building a new container image.
* The `system.ip` parameter is replaced with the appropriate hostname to access your system microservice.
* The `inventory.ip` parameter is replaced with the appropriate hostname to access your inventory microservice.

If the tests pass, you see an output for each service similar to the following example:

== Tearing down the environment

When you no longer need your deployed microservices, you can use the same configuration file to delete them.
Run the following command to delete your deployments, systems, and routes:

[role=command]
```
oc delete -f deploy.yaml
```

To completely delete your Minishift VM, cluster, and all associated files, refer to the official 
https://docs.okd.io/latest/minishift/getting-started/uninstalling.html[Uninstalling Minishift^] documentation.

To revert back to your default Docker settings, simply close your command-line session.

== Great work! You're done!

You just deployed two microservices running in Open Liberty to an OKD cluster using the `oc` tool.
